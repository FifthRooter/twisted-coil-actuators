A project I worked on as a student assisstant, trying to manufacture nylon based twisted coil actuators, powered by resistance heated wires, with the goal of designing a breathing trainer vest that could contract and expand to assist children with breathing problems.

Initial testing was promising, but ultimately the idea was scrapped in favor of regular small servo motors due to several factors:
1. Heat dissipation - in order to get strong enough an actuation force, several individual coils needed to be combined together, which made it very difficult to cool them down fast enough to allow for rapid contraction/relaxation cycles that could match the rate of breathing of a child;
2. Safety - embedding resistance heating-based TCAs posed a safety risk that could not be easily done away with by using feedback sensors. Occasionally, overheating of the coils resulted in the nylon melting and breaking. And in case of some feedback loop failure, the resistance wire could heat up too much and cause discomfort at best, and set the vest material on fire at worst.
3. Feedback Control System - direct measurement of the resistance wire's temperature was practically impossible due to it being tightly woven into the nylon fishing line, and hence it was difficult to accurately determine when to stop the heating, which resulted in the TCAs melting after having reached the optimal actuation temperature. Using wire's resistance measurement as a function of its temperature was explored, but due to the several other drawbacks, was never implemented.
